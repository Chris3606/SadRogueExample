    /// (using GoRogue) and the translation to integration library structure occurs here.

    /// directly to the map.  The integration library also supports creating subclasses of RogueLikeMap (as we do
    /// here).

    /// Additionally, GoRogue's map generation framework supports adding arbitrary components to contexts, so the integration
    /// library map could be added as a component to the context, and then things like enemy placement could be their own
    /// custom GoRogue map generation steps.
